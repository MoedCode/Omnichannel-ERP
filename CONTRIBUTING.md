## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

* Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
* Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Maximum line length of 100 characters
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add docstrings to all classes and functions

### Django Best Practices

* Follow Django's [coding style](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/)
* Use Django's built-in features when possible
* Keep views thin, models fat
* Use Django's ORM efficiently
* Write reusable code

### API Design

* Follow RESTful principles
* Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
* Return appropriate status codes
* Include proper error messages
* Document all endpoints in Swagger

### Testing

* Write tests for new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for high code coverage
* Test edge cases

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Database Migrations

* Create migrations for model changes:
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```

* Always check migration files before committing
* Write reversible migrations when possible
* Add helpful comments for complex migrations

### Git Commit Messages

* Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* First line should be 50 characters or less
* Add detailed description if needed after a blank line

Example:
```
